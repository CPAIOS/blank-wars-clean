# Blank Wars Project Handoff - Gemini - 2025-07-06

This document summarizes the work performed, lessons learned, and future plans for the Blank Wars project by the Gemini AI agent. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview for seamless handoff to another AI or human developer.

## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

**Blank Wars** is a reality show mockumentary game where users (Coaches) manage AI-powered Fighters from various historical periods, places, or legends. The core gameplay revolves around managing AI personalities with authentic psychological needs in a multiverse team combat league.

## ðŸš€ Current State of the Project (as of 2025-07-06)

*   **Backend Status:** Running successfully on `http://localhost:3006`.
    *   **Database:** SQLite with demo data (in-memory for development).
    *   **Redis:** Using in-memory cache (development mode) due to `REDIS_URL` being removed from `.env` to prevent connection errors.
    *   **OpenAI API:** Configured with a placeholder key (`sk-your-openai-api-key-here`) in `.env`.
    *   **Environment Variables:** A `.env` file has been created in the `backend/` directory containing necessary environment variables, including placeholder values for `QR_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as per user instruction for testing purposes.
*   **Frontend Status:** Running successfully on `http://localhost:3007`.
*   **Known Issues (from `BLANK_WARS_DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF_2025-07-05.md`):**
    *   **Broken Core Features:**
        *   Kitchen Table Chat - Producing repetitive garbage responses.
        *   Individual Character Chat - Incorrectly shows "out of chats" on first use.
        *   Battle Tab - Completely crashes when accessed.
        *   Equipment System - Items cannot be equipped or added to character slots.
        *   Authentication System - No way to log in, can't access Coach profile.
    *   **Missing Features:** Confessionals Tab (needs full AI interview implementation).
    *   **Non-Functional Elements:** Facilities Tab, Available Fighters Tab, Tutorial Button, Coach Profile.

## âœ… My Contributions (What I've Done)

1.  **Initial Setup & Dependency Installation:**
    *   Cloned the `blank-wars-clean` repository.
    *   Installed backend and frontend dependencies using `npm install`.
2.  **Troubleshooting `nodemon` and `ts-node` Configuration:**
    *   Identified and resolved "nodemon: command not found" by changing the `dev` script in `backend/package.json` to `nodemon --exec ts-node src/server.ts`.
3.  **Fixing TypeScript Compilation Errors:**
    *   **`backend/src/services/battleService.ts`:**
        *   Resolved `Element implicitly has an 'any' type` for `global.io` by casting to `(global as any).io`.
        *   Added `origin_era?: string;` and `bond_level?: number;` to the `BattleCharacter` interface to resolve `Property 'origin_era'/'bond_level' does not exist` errors.
    *   **`backend/src/services/hostmasterService.ts`:**
        *   Resolved `Element implicitly has an 'any' type` for `global.io` by casting to `(global as any).io`.
    *   **`backend/src/services/aiChatService.ts`:**
        *   Resolved `TS18004: No value exists in scope for the shorthand property 'messages'` by declaring `messages` and `systemPrompt` outside the `try` block and initializing `messages` to an empty array.
4.  **Addressing Environment Variable Issues:**
    *   Identified the need for a `.env` file due to missing `QR_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` errors.
    *   Created `backend/.env` with placeholder values for `QR_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and test values for `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `CSRF_SECRET` (as per user's one-time instruction for testing).
5.  **Resolving SQLite `archetype` Constraint Error:**
    *   Identified that the `characters` table `CHECK` constraint in `backend/src/database/sqlite.ts` was too restrictive.
    *   Expanded the `archetype` list in the `CHECK` constraint to include all archetypes present in the seeded character data (`'mage', 'mystic', 'tank', 'assassin'`).
    *   Deleted `backend/data/blankwars.db` to force a recreation of the database with the updated schema.
6.  **Addressing Redis Connection Errors:**
    *   Identified that the `REDIS_URL` in `.env` was causing connection attempts to a non-existent Redis server.
    *   Removed the `REDIS_URL` line from `backend/.env` to allow the application to correctly fall back to the in-memory cache.
7.  **Resolving Frontend Port Conflict:**
    *   Identified `EADDRINUSE` error on port 3007 for the frontend.
    *   Terminated the process using port 3007.

## ðŸ§  My Learnings/Key Discoveries

*   **Project Stack:** Node.js/TypeScript (backend with Express), Next.js/TypeScript (frontend).
*   **Data Persistence:** Backend uses SQLite for primary data storage (in-memory for development) and Redis for caching (with an in-memory fallback).
*   **Environment Variables:** Critical for application configuration. The project relies on `.env` files for local development. Missing or incorrect values can prevent server startup.
*   **Character & Ability Data Structure:**
    *   Frontend character definitions are in `frontend/src/data/characters.ts` (using `characterTemplates`).
    *   Frontend ability definitions are in `frontend/src/data/abilities.ts` (using `Ability` interface and `allAbilities` array).
    *   Character progression and skill unlocking are managed via `ProgressionTree` and `ProgressionNode` in `frontend/src/data/characters.ts` and `frontend/src/data/characterProgression.ts`.
    *   Backend character data in `backend/src/database/sqlite.ts` is a simplified representation, primarily for seeding the database.
*   **Debugging Strategy:** Systematically checking logs, inspecting file contents, and using shell commands (`lsof`, `stat`, `rm`, `npm cache clean`) were crucial for diagnosing and resolving issues.

## ðŸ”® Future Plans (What I Plan to Do Next)

1.  **Integrate New Character & Skill Data:**
    *   **Immediate Next Step:** Process the content of the `characters and skills.txt` file (once its content is successfully provided).
    *   **Action:** Parse the text data into structured `Character` and `Ability` objects.
    *   **Action:** Update `frontend/src/data/characters.ts` with new `characterTemplates` and include them in `createDemoCharacterCollection()`.
    *   **Action:** Update `frontend/src/data/abilities.ts` with new `Ability` objects.
    *   **Action:** Update `backend/src/database/sqlite.ts` to seed the new characters into the database.
2.  **Address Known Issues (from `BLANK_WARS_DEVELOPMENT_HANDOFF_2025-07-05.md`):**
    *   **High Priority:**
        *   Debug Kitchen Table Chat (repetitive responses).
        *   Fix Individual Character Chat ("out of chats" error).
        *   Fix Battle Tab crash.
        *   Implement Authentication system.
        *   Fix Equipment System.
    *   **Medium Priority:**
        *   Implement Confessionals Tab.
        *   Implement Facilities Tab.
        *   Fix Available Fighters Tab.
        *   Fix Tutorial Button.
        *   Fix Coach Profile content display.

## ðŸ“‚ Useful Handoff Information

*   **Project Root:** `/Users/stevengreenstein/Documents/blank-wars-clean`
*   **Backend Directory:** `backend/` (runs on `http://localhost:3006`)
*   **Frontend Directory:** `frontend/` (runs on `http://localhost:3007`)
*   **Key Backend Files:**
    *   `backend/src/server.ts` (main server entry)
    *   `backend/src/database/sqlite.ts` (database schema and seeding)
    *   `backend/src/services/aiChatService.ts` (OpenAI integration)
    *   `backend/src/services/battleService.ts` (battle logic)
    *   `backend/src/services/hostmasterService.ts` (announcer AI)
    *   `backend/.env` (environment variables - **currently contains placeholder values for `QR_SECRET` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`**)
*   **Key Frontend Files:**
    *   `frontend/src/data/characters.ts` (character definitions)
    *   `frontend/src/data/abilities.ts` (ability definitions)
    *   `frontend/src/data/characterProgression.ts` (leveling and progression)
*   **Important Logs:**
    *   `backend/nodemon_output.log`
    *   `frontend/frontend_output.log`
*   **Environment Variable Setup:** A `.env` file in `backend/` is essential. The current `.env` uses test values for JWT/CSRF and placeholders for API keys. For production or full functionality, these placeholders would need to be replaced with actual, secure keys.
*   **Test Commands:**
    *   `cd backend && npm test`
    *   `cd frontend && npm test`

---

**ðŸŽ¯ Mission for Next Session:** The immediate priority is to integrate the new character and skill data from the `characters and skills.txt` file. Once that is complete, focus will shift to addressing the critical known issues to make the game fully playable.
