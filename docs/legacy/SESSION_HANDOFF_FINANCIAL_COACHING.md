*Generated: 2025-07-15*

## 📋 Project Context & Background

**Project**: Blank Wars - Advanced character battle/management game with psychological AI systems  
**Current Feature**: Financial Coaching System - A comprehensive money-stress psychology loop where characters' financial situations affect their decision-making quality, creating realistic coaching challenges.

**Core Concept**: Characters earn money from battles → Make financial decisions → Stress from poor outcomes → Degraded decision quality → Worse outcomes (spiral) → Coach intervention needed to break cycles → AI battle system triggers dynamic financial decisions.

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps for New Agent

### Priority 1: Complete Task 13 - AI Judge System for Financial Outcomes

**Objective**: Extend the existing AI Judge system to evaluate financial decisions and their outcomes, providing commentary and assessment.

**What to implement**:
1. **Financial Decision Evaluation**: Add financial decision types to AI Judge evaluation criteria
2. **Outcome Assessment**: Judge evaluates financial decision outcomes (good/bad advice, risk assessment)
3. **Commentary Integration**: AI Judge provides commentary on financial spirals, trust changes, wildcard decisions
4. **Coach Performance Evaluation**: Judge assesses coach's financial advice effectiveness
5. **Integration with Battle System**: Judge evaluates battle-triggered financial decisions

**Key Technical Steps**:
- Research existing AI Judge system in `/Users/gabrielgreenstein/blank-wars-clean/frontend/src/data/aiJudgeSystem.ts`
- Add financial decision evaluation criteria to judge personalities
- Create financial outcome assessment functions
- Integrate with battle financial service for real-time evaluation
- Add judge commentary for financial events in UI

### Priority 2: System Integration Testing
- Test battle earnings → financial decisions → stress changes → relationship impacts
- Verify AI Judge evaluates financial outcomes correctly
- Ensure coach trust system affects judge evaluations
- Test spiral detection and intervention effectiveness

## 💡 Important Implementation Notes

### Architecture Philosophy:
- **Event-driven design**: All financial changes flow through GameEventBus
- **Psychology-first approach**: Every financial action has mental health consequences
- **AI integration**: Battle AI and Judge AI work together for comprehensive evaluation
- **Coach agency**: Coach advice meaningfully impacts outcomes when trust is high

### Key Integration Patterns:
- **Battle Events → Financial Decisions**: Critical hits trigger spending sprees
- **Financial Stress → Battle Performance**: Worry reduces combat effectiveness
- **Trust Changes → Decision Quality**: Low trust = ignored advice
- **Judge Evaluation → Coach Feedback**: AI provides performance assessment

### Testing Approach:
- Create characters with different financial personalities
- Trigger battle events → observe financial decisions
- Test coach interventions and trust changes
- Verify AI Judge evaluates outcomes correctly

## 🚀 Long-term Vision

The financial coaching system is building toward a realistic psychological simulation where:
- Money stress affects all character behavior (battle performance, relationships, decisions)
- Battle emotions trigger authentic financial choices (victory splurges, defeat desperation)
- Coach intervention becomes critical for breaking negative spirals
- AI systems work together to create believable character psychology

**Current Status**: Core psychology loop working with battle integration complete. AI Judge integration needed for comprehensive evaluation system.

**Estimated Completion**: Task 13 = ~1 session, Full system integration = ~2-3 sessions

The foundation is solid with sophisticated battle-financial integration. The next agent should focus on AI Judge integration for comprehensive outcome evaluation and then move to broader system integration (therapy, conflict systems).
