## I. Critical Issues (Highest Priority - Must Address Immediately)

These issues represent fundamental flaws or major inconsistencies that will prevent the application from functioning correctly or lead to significant problems in development and maintenance.

### 1. Frontend Authentication Disconnect:
- **Issue**: frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx is hardcoded to a DEMO_USER, completely bypassing the backend authentication system for its primary user state.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Modify `AuthContext.tsx`:
    - Remove the DEMO_USER initialization from frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx.
    - In the useEffect hook within AuthProvider, implement logic to:
      - Check for the presence of authentication tokens (e.g., by attempting to retrieve them from httpOnly cookies, which authService.ts already handles).
      - If tokens exist, call authService.getProfile() to fetch the actual user data from the backend.
      - Set the user state based on the fetched profile.
      - Handle loading states (isLoading) and errors during this process, ensuring the UI reflects the authentication status accurately.
      - If no valid tokens are found or getProfile fails, ensure the user state is null and isAuthenticated is false.

### 2. Backend `userService.ts` is a Mock:
- **Issue**: backend/src/services/userService.ts is a mock implementation, while other backend services (like server.ts, battleService.ts) and the frontend expect persistent user data.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Refactor `userService.ts`:
    - Modify backend/src/services/userService.ts to interact with the PostgreSQL database (via dbAdapter or direct query calls from backend/src/database/index.ts) instead of using in-memory arrays.
    - Implement the following methods to perform actual database operations on the users table (and potentially user_profiles or friendships tables if they are fully implemented in the database schema):
      - findUserById(id: string): Query the users table.
      - findUserProfile(userId: string): Query the users table (or a joined user_profiles table if it exists).
      - updateUserProfile(userId: string, updates: Partial<UserProfile>): Update the users table.
      - addFriend(userId1: string, userId2: string): Insert into a friendships table.
      - acceptFriendRequest(friendshipId: string): Update friendships table.
      - rejectFriendRequest(friendshipId: string): Update friendships table.
      - getFriends(userId: string): Query friendships and users tables.
      - getPendingFriendRequests(userId: string): Query friendships table.
      - searchUsers(query: string): Query users table.
    - Ensure data consistency by using the same User and UserProfile types as defined in backend/src/types/user.ts.

### 3. Character Data Discrepancy:
- **Issue**: backend/src/database/sqlite.ts seeds 5 characters, database-setup.sql inserts 10, and frontend/src/data/characters.ts defines 17.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Update `database-setup.sql`:
    - Modify the INSERT statements for the characters table in database-setup.sql to include all 17 characters defined in frontend/src/data/characters.ts.
    - Ensure that all character data, including personality_traits, conversation_topics, and abilities, are correctly serialized as JSON strings (or JSONB if PostgreSQL is used) and inserted into the respective columns.
    - Verify that the character IDs and data structures in frontend/src/data/characters.ts precisely match the schema and data expected by the backend.
  - Remove `seedCharacters` from `sqlite.ts`:
    - Delete the seedCharacters function from backend/src/database/sqlite.ts.
    - Instead, create a separate Node.js script (e.g., backend/scripts/seedDevCharacters.ts) that reads the 17 characters from frontend/src/data/characters.ts and inserts them into the SQLite database using dbAdapter or direct query calls. This script should be run once during development setup.

### 4. Frontend Systems Directly Import Backend `dbAdapter` and `analyticsService`:
- **Issue**: frontend/src/systems/battleEngine.ts directly imports dbAdapter and analyticsService, which are backend modules. This is a critical architectural violation.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Remove Direct Imports: Delete the import { dbAdapter } from '../services/databaseAdapter'; and import { analyticsService } from '../services/analytics'; statements from frontend/src/systems/battleEngine.ts.
  - Implement API Calls: Replace any direct calls to dbAdapter or analyticsService within frontend/src/systems/battleEngine.ts (and any other frontend files that might have similar issues) with appropriate HTTP (using apiClient.ts) or WebSocket (using battleWebSocket.ts) calls to the backend API endpoints.
  - Define Frontend Interfaces: If necessary, define frontend-specific interfaces for data received from the backend to maintain type safety without importing backend types. This ensures a clear separation of concerns.

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline - Non-Blocking Quality Checks:
- **Issue**: ci.yml uses continue-on-error: true for linting, type checking, and security scans, allowing quality issues to accumulate.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Remove `continue-on-error`: In .github/workflows/ci.yml, remove continue-on-error: true from the linting, type checking, and security-scan steps in backend-tests, frontend-tests, and security-scan jobs.
  - This will force the CI pipeline to fail if any linting errors, type errors, or high-severity security vulnerabilities are detected, ensuring code quality is enforced and preventing the accumulation of technical debt.

## II. High Priority Issues (Should Address Soon)

These issues are significant and will impact the application's robustness, maintainability, or user experience if not addressed.

### 1. Duplicate Backend Route Definitions:
- **Issue**: backend/src/server.ts directly defines authentication and user routes, making backend/src/routes/auth.ts and backend/src/routes/userRoutes.ts effectively dead code.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Modularize Routing:
    - In backend/src/server.ts, remove the directly defined authentication routes (app.post('/api/auth/register', ...) etc.) and user routes (app.get('/api/user/characters', ...) etc.).
    - Import the routers from backend/src/routes/auth.ts and backend/src/routes/userRoutes.ts (e.g., import authRouter from './routes/auth'; and import userRouter from './routes/userRoutes';).
    - Integrate them into the Express app using app.use('/api/auth', authRouter); and app.use('/api/users', userRouter);.
    - Ensure all other routes currently defined directly in server.ts are also moved into dedicated route files within backend/src/routes/ for better organization and modularity.

### 2. Frontend `battleWebSocket.ts` and Backend `server.ts` Discrepancy:
- **Issue**: Frontend sends { token: accessToken } for WebSocket auth, backend expects token string. Frontend uses legacy WebSocket events.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Fix WebSocket Auth Payload: In frontend/src/services/battleWebSocket.ts, change the authenticateWithToken method to emit just the token string: this.socket.emit('auth', accessToken); instead of this.socket.emit('auth', { token: accessToken });.
  - Remove Legacy Events: In frontend/src/services/battleWebSocket.ts, remove or comment out the socket.on('authenticate', ...) and socket.on('find_battle', ...) event listeners and any corresponding calls. Ensure the frontend only uses the current find_match event for matchmaking.

### 3. Numerous Linting Errors (Frontend):
- **Issue**: frontend/lint_output.txt shows many ESLint errors and warnings.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Systematic Cleanup: Go through each file listed in frontend/lint_output.txt and resolve all reported issues. This includes:
    - Removing unused import statements and deleting declarations of variables or functions that are never referenced (@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars).
    - Changing let declarations to const for any variables that are not reassigned after their initial declaration (prefer-const).
    - Replacing any types with specific, well-defined types or interfaces (@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any). This is a significant effort but crucial for type safety.
    - Correctly specifying all dependencies in the dependency arrays of useEffect, useCallback, and useMemo hooks (react-hooks/exhaustive-deps).
    - Converting all require() calls to ES module import statements (@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports).
  - Integrate Linting into Dev Workflow: Configure IDEs (e.g., VS Code with ESLint extension) to show linting errors in real-time. Consider adding a pre-commit hook (e.g., using Husky and lint-staged) to automatically run linting and fix issues before commits.

### 4. Inconsistent TypeScript Strict Mode (Frontend):
- **Issue**: frontend/ARCHITECTURE_DOCUMENTATION.md claims strict mode, but frontend/tsconfig.json sets "strict": false.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Enable Strict Mode: In frontend/tsconfig.json, change "strict": false to "strict": true.
  - Resolve New Errors: This will likely introduce a large number of new TypeScript errors. Systematically resolve these errors, which will significantly improve the codebase's type safety and reliability. This effort will overlap with resolving @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any linting errors.
  - Update Documentation: Once strict mode is fully enforced and all errors are resolved, update docs/frontend-architecture-documentation.md (or the relevant section in docs/architecture-overview.md) to accurately reflect this.

### 5. Large Monolithic Components (Frontend):
- **Issue**: frontend/src/components/ImprovedBattleArena.tsx (2,412 lines) and frontend/src/components/TrainingGrounds.tsx (1,419 lines) are excessively large.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Component Decomposition: Break down these large components into smaller, more focused, and reusable sub-components. For example:
    - For ImprovedBattleArena.tsx: Extract sections like BattleHUD, CombatLogDisplay, StrategySelectionPanel, CharacterStatsDisplay, CoachingInterface, RogueActionDisplay, BattleRewardsSummary, etc.
    - For TrainingGrounds.tsx: Extract CharacterInfoPanel, TrainingActivityList, TrainingProgressDisplay, SkillTreeViewer, FacilitySelector, MembershipDetails, etc.
  - Prop Drilling vs. Context: Use props to pass data down to child components. For widely used data, consider creating dedicated React Contexts (e.g., BattleContext, TrainingContext) to avoid excessive prop drilling.

## III. Medium Priority Issues (Address as Time Permits)

These issues are important for long-term health and scalability but may not block initial launch.

### 1. Frontend Systems Rely on Mocked/Incomplete Logic:
- **Issue**: Many frontend systems (battleEngine.ts, coachingSystem.ts, postBattleAnalysis.ts, trainingSystem.ts) have placeholder or simplified logic for complex psychological interactions and dynamic behavior.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Iterative Implementation: Systematically replace mock logic with the full, dynamic implementations as described in the game design. This will involve:
    - Implementing the detailed psychological models for character behavior.
    - Developing the full range of coaching outcomes and their effects.
    - Fleshing out the post-battle analysis to generate rich narratives and accurate progression.
    - Ensuring all these interactions are driven by data from the backend API.

### 2. Missing Unit Tests for `useBattleAnnouncer`:
- **Issue**: A dedicated test file for frontend/src/hooks/useBattleAnnouncer.ts was not found.
- **Actionable Suggestion**: Create frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useBattleAnnouncer.test.ts and write unit tests to verify its functionality, including queuing, speaking, voice selection, and error handling.

### 3. Outdated/Unused Dependencies (Backend & Frontend):
- **Issue**: Potential for outdated dependencies and security vulnerabilities.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Regular Audits: Regularly run npm outdated and npm audit in both backend/ and frontend/ directories.
  - Update Dependencies: Prioritize updating minor and patch versions. For major version updates, carefully review changelogs for breaking changes and plan updates accordingly.
  - Remove Unused: Identify and remove any unused dependencies from package.json to reduce bundle size and attack surface.

### 4. Docker Best Practices (Backend):
- **Issue**: The Dockerfile could be improved with multi-stage builds and running as a non-root user.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Multi-Stage Build: Implement a multi-stage Dockerfile for the backend to create a smaller, more secure production image. One stage for building (with dev dependencies) and another for running (with only production dependencies).
  - Non-Root User: Add instructions to the Dockerfile to create a non-root user and run the application as that user, reducing potential security risks.

### 5. Environment Variable Management:
- **Issue**: Ensure consistent and secure management of environment variables across all environments.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Comprehensive `.env.example`: Create a single, comprehensive .env.example file at the project root that lists all environment variables required for both frontend and backend, along with clear descriptions and example values.
  - Secure Handling: Ensure that sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys, secrets) are never committed to version control and are securely managed in production environments (e.g., using GitHub Secrets, Railway/Vercel environment variables, Kubernetes Secrets).

## IV. Low Priority Issues (Address as Polish/Cleanup)

These issues are minor and primarily relate to code tidiness or non-critical aspects.

### 1. Leftover Temporary Files (Backend & Frontend):
- **Issue**: backend/cookies.txt, frontend/test-audio.html, frontend/lint_output.txt are present.
- **Actionable Suggestion**:
  - Delete backend/cookies.txt. Add cookies.txt to backend/.gitignore.
  - Delete frontend/test-audio.html and frontend/lint_output.txt. If test-audio.html is a useful development utility, move it to a dedicated tools/frontend-dev-demos/ directory at the project root and add tools/ to the main .gitignore.

### 2. Incomplete HTML Files at Root:
- **Issue**: Several HTML files are present directly in the root directory.
- **Actionable Suggestion**: Create a new directory at the project root named demos/ or standalone-tools/. Move all standalone HTML files into this new directory. If any of these represent core UI components, consider migrating them into the Next.js application as proper React components and pages.

### 3. Truncated Text Files:
- **Issue**: _____ Wars Chat.txt and blank_wars_chat_log_claude_6-27-25.txt were truncated.
- **Actionable Suggestion**: Locate the original, complete versions of these files and replace the truncated versions. If the complete versions are permanently lost, add a clear comment at the top of each file stating that the content is incomplete or truncated.

### 4. Duplicate Dependency (Backend):
- **Issue**: Both bcrypt and bcryptjs are listed in backend/package.json.
- **Actionable Suggestion**: Choose either bcrypt or bcryptjs based on project needs (e.g., native performance vs. pure JavaScript compatibility). Remove the other package from dependencies in backend/package.json and run npm install.

### 5. Missing Backend `.gitignore`:
- **Issue**: There is no dedicated .gitignore file in the backend/ directory.
- **Actionable Suggestion**: Create a .gitignore file in the backend/ directory to manage backend-specific ignored files (e.g., dist/, node_modules/, .env). While the root .gitignore covers many common cases, a dedicated one can improve clarity and prevent accidental commits of backend-specific artifacts.
