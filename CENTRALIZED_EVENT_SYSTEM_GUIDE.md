## üéØ Core Features

### 1. **Persistent Character Memory**
Characters now remember events across ALL game systems:
- Battle victories and defeats
- Therapy breakthroughs and setbacks  
- Training achievements and struggles
- Kitchen conflicts and resolutions
- Equipment changes and preferences
- Social interactions and relationship changes

**Before**: Characters had no memory between scenes
**After**: Characters reference past experiences naturally in conversation

### 2. **Cross-System Awareness**
Characters are now aware of events from other game areas:
- Equipment advisor mentions recent battle stress affecting gear choices
- Performance coach references kitchen conflicts impacting focus
- Therapist knows about training exhaustion and battle trauma
- Skills trainer aware of relationship dynamics affecting learning

### 3. **Strategic Conflict Resolution**
Engaging with conflicts now provides significant rewards:
- **Experience Multipliers**: 100-200 XP for resolution vs 10-30 for avoidance
- **Stat Boosts**: Temporary +2-5 stat increases for 48-96 hours
- **Skill Unlocks**: Permanent abilities only available through conflict resolution
- **Relationship Bonuses**: Build lasting bonds that enhance all interactions

### 4. **Smart Context Compression**
AI gets rich context without overwhelming prompts:

## üéÆ How It Works In Game

### **Character Conversations**

**Old System**:
```
Coach: "How can I help with your training today?"
```

**New System**:
```
Coach: "I know the kitchen situation with Joan is stressing you out, and 
that loss to Tesla yesterday shook your confidence. Let's work on combat 
techniques to rebuild your focus - your attack is at 85 now, up from 78 
last week."
```

Characters now:
- Reference specific recent events
- Mention actual stats and current state
- Connect different areas of your game experience
- Show awareness of relationship dynamics

### **Performance Coaching Chat**

Characters are now aware of:
- **Your exact level, stats, and experience points**
- **Win/loss record with specific numbers**: "You've won 7 out of 12 recent battles"
- **Recent training progress**: References skills learned and stat improvements  
- **Household tensions**: How living conflicts affect battle performance
- **Equipment changes**: How new gear impacts combat effectiveness

**Example Enhanced Response**:
```
"Your attack stat of 92 is impressive, but I noticed your win rate dropped 
to 58% after that kitchen argument with Achilles. The team chemistry is at 
75% - we need to work on focus techniques since that housing stress is 
affecting your reaction time in battles."
```

### **Equipment Advisor Chat**

Characters now reference:
- **Current equipped items by name**: "Your Iron Sword is solid, but..."
- **Specific inventory contents**: "I see you have a Flame Blade in storage"
- **Stat-based recommendations**: "With your 85 attack, this weapon would boost you to 92"
- **Recent battle performance**: "Since that defeat cost you confidence, maybe a stronger shield"

**Example Enhanced Response**:
```
"I notice you're still using the Iron Sword from last week, but with your 
attack now at 85, that Flame Blade in your inventory would be perfect. 
Plus, after losing to the Tesla team, a confidence boost from better gear 
might help your next battle."
```

### **Skill Development Chat**

Characters track:
- **Current abilities with specific names and cooldowns**
- **Available training points**: "You have 23 skill points to spend"
- **Learning progress**: References recently acquired skills
- **Archetype optimization**: Suggests skills based on your fighting style

**Example Enhanced Response**:
```
"You've learned 3 abilities so far - Warrior's Strike, Shield Bash, and 
Iron Will. With 23 training points available and your Warrior archetype, 
I recommend focusing on defensive skills since your defense is only 67. 
The stress from household conflicts shows you need better mental resilience."
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Event Publishing**

Every significant game action now creates trackable events:

**Battle System**:
```typescript
// Automatically publishes on battle completion
await eventPublisher.publishBattleEvent({
  winnerId: 'achilles',
  loserId: 'tesla_team',
  participants: ['achilles', 'joan', 'holmes'],
  battleDuration: 1200000,
  teamworkRating: 85,
  strategyUsed: 'collaborative'
});
```

**Therapy System**:
```typescript
// Publishes on therapy breakthrough
await eventPublisher.publishTherapyEvent({
  characterId: 'achilles',
  sessionType: 'individual',
  breakthroughs: ['anger_management'],
  conflictsAddressed: ['kitchen_disputes']
});
```

**Training System**:
```typescript
// Publishes on training completion
await eventPublisher.publishTrainingSession({
  characterId: 'achilles',
  trainingType: 'combat_technique',
  skillsFocused: ['sword_work'],
  improvement: 'significant'
});
```

### **Context Generation**

Smart context is automatically generated for each chat:

```typescript
// Performance coaching gets battle-focused context
const context = await eventContextService.getPerformanceContext(characterId);
// Returns: "PERFORMANCE: 7W/3L (70% win rate, üìà improving)"

// Equipment chat gets gear-focused context  
const context = await eventContextService.getEquipmentContext(characterId);
// Returns: "EQUIPMENT: Recent changes - Iron Sword equipped, Flame Blade available"
```

### **Memory Persistence**

Character memories are automatically created and ranked:

```typescript
// High-importance events become lasting memories
memory = {
  content: "Epic victory against overwhelming odds",
  importance: 9, // 1-10 scale
  emotional_intensity: 8,
  emotional_valence: 'positive',
  associated_characters: ['joan', 'holmes']
}
```
