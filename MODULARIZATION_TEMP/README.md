# TeamHeadquarters.tsx Modularization - SAFE WORKSPACE

This folder contains all work for safely modularizing the massive TeamHeadquarters.tsx file.

## 🔒 SAFETY PROTOCOL

**NEVER modify the original file directly!**

### Workflow:
1. **Work in this temp folder** to extract and build modular components
2. **Test extracted components** independently 
3. **Build complete modular version** in this temp folder
4. **Compare functionality** with original
5. **Only when 100% verified** - replace original with modular version

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `TeamHeadquarters_ORIGINAL.tsx` - Untouched backup of original 3,189-line file
- `types/` - Extracted TypeScript interfaces
- `data/` - Extracted constants and static data
- `utils/` - Extracted utility functions
- `services/` - Extracted service functions
- `components/` - Extracted sub-components
- `TeamHeadquarters_MODULAR.tsx` - Final modular version (will be small!)

## 🎯 Current Status

- ✅ Original file backed up safely
- ✅ Initial types extracted
- ⏳ Ready for systematic extraction

## 🚨 Rules

1. **Never touch** `/frontend/src/components/TeamHeadquarters.tsx` until final replacement
2. **Work only** in this MODULARIZATION_TEMP folder
3. **Test everything** before final replacement
4. **Keep detailed logs** of all extractions
