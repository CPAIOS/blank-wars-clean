### General Approach for Other Characters

For the remaining characters (e.g., Thug, Wolf, Nostradamus, Fenrir, etc.), apply the following steps:

1. **Basic Information**:
   - Use provided Name, Title, Archetype, Rarity, and Description.
   - Assign an avatar emoji (e.g., üê∫ for Wolf, üîÆ for Nostradamus).
   - Set `historicalPeriod` and `mythology` based on context (e.g., 'N/A' for animals, 'Greek' for Circe).

2. **Personality**:
   - Expand traits to 4-6 (e.g., Thug: Aggressive, Cunning ‚Üí Aggressive, Cunning, Ruthless, Opportunistic).
   - Define `speechStyle` from provided style or infer (e.g., Wolf: "Growls and howls").
   - Add 1-2 motivations and fears if missing (e.g., Wolf: add 'Pack loyalty' to motivations, 'Hunters' to fears).

3. **Base Stats**:

     - Mage: High Intelligence/Wisdom (20-30 Common, 40-95 Mythic)
     - Tank: High Vitality (25-30 Common, 50-95 Legendary)
   - Scale totals by rarity: ~90-100 for Common, ~150-200 for Uncommon/Rare, ~300-450 for Epic/Legendary/Mythic.

     - Legendary: Health 200-500, Attack/Defense 25-50, Mana 40-120
   - Match qualitative descriptions (e.g., Wolf: high speed ‚Üí Speed 20).

     - Town Guard: High training/teamPlayer (80/70), low ego (20)
     - Circe: High ego (80), moderate communication (60)

6. **Battle AI**:
   - Set aggression/defensiveness/riskTaking/adaptability (0-100) based on role:
     - Tanks: High defensiveness (80-90)
     - Assassins: High aggression (70-90)
   - Choose 2-3 `preferredStrategies` (e.g., Fenrir: 'flank', 'bite').

### Skills Integration

The query provides unique skills (e.g., Town Guard: Shield Wall, Loyal Protector), but the character template excludes abilities, relegating them to `abilities.ts`. Here‚Äôs how to handle them:

- **Assumption**: Skills are defined separately and linked via `progressionTree` (not included in the template).
- **Example for Town Guard** (from query):
  ```typescript
  export const townGuardShieldWall: Ability = {
    id: "town-guard-shield-wall",
    name: "Shield Wall",
    description: "Increases defense by 20% for 2 turns.",
    type: "active",
    characterId: "town-guard",
    archetype: "warrior",
    icon: "shield-icon",
    effects: [{ type: "defenseBoost", value: 20, duration: 2 }],
    cost: { mana: 10 },
    flavor: "A wall of steel and resolve.",
    unlockLevel: 1,
    maxRank: 3,
    rankBonuses: [
      { rank: 2, effect: { type: "defenseBoost", value: 25 } },
      { rank: 3, effect: { type: "defenseBoost", value: 30 } }
    ]
  };

  export const townGuardLoyalProtector: Ability = {
    id: "town-guard-loyal-protector",
    name: "Loyal Protector",
    description: "Increases defense by 5% when health is below 50%.",
    type: "passive",
    characterId: "town-guard",
    archetype: "warrior",
    icon: "protector-icon",
    effects: [{ type: "defenseBoost", value: 5, condition: "healthBelow50" }],
    cost: {},
    flavor: "Duty never falters.",
    unlockLevel: 3,
    maxRank: 1,
    rankBonuses: []
  };
  ```
- **Process**: Apply this format to all provided skills, adjusting effects, costs, and unlock levels based on rarity and archetype.
