# Blank Wars Project Status - Gemini - 2025-07-13

## 1. Session Summary
This session focused on identifying and deploying critical uncommitted changes to address application failures.

- **Identified Local Changes:** We discovered significant uncommitted modifications in the local environment across both the frontend and backend, primarily related to authentication services, user routes, and the team chat panel.
- **Verified Git History:** We confirmed that all recent commits on the remote `main` branch were authored by `Green003-CPAOS`, ensuring it was safe to proceed.
- **Committed and Pushed Fixes:** The local changes were committed and pushed to the `origin/main` branch in commit `72861f2`.

The user has reported that this push resulted in build failures, which will be investigated by another agent.

## 2. Synthesized Project Understanding
Based on a review of multiple handoff documents and our interactions, here is a synthesized overview of the project's state and recurring challenges.

### 2.1. Core Architecture
- **Project:** "Blank Wars" is a full-stack 3v3 battle game.
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, with a database layer using SQLite.
- **Deployment:** The application is deployed on Railway and/or Vercel, which has been a source of continuous issues.

### 2.2. Key Recurring Challenges

This project faces several interconnected challenges that have persisted across multiple development sessions:

**A. Deployment and Build Instability:**
- **The most significant blocker.** The application frequently fails to build on the deployment platform (Vercel/Railway).
- **Causes have included:**
    - Incorrect "Root Directory" settings on the deployment platform.
    - PostCSS and Tailwind CSS configuration errors, especially related to Tailwind v4 and Next.js 15.
    - TypeScript compilation errors (e.g., duplicate properties, syntax errors) that were not caught locally.
    - Missing dependencies (`autoprefixer`) in the deployment environment.

**B. Authentication System Fragility:**
- This is the most critical user-facing issue.
- **Symptoms:** Users experience `401 Unauthorized` errors, `Token expired` messages, and `Invalid credentials` on login.
- **Root Causes:**
    - Short token expiration times (previously 15 minutes).
    - Incorrect API endpoint paths for authentication and profile fetching.
    - Discrepancies between local and production authentication middleware.
    - The latest push (`72861f2`) was intended to fix these issues, but the subsequent build failure prevents verification.

**C. API and Data Inconsistency:**
- There is a history of mismatches between the frontend's API calls and the backend's route definitions.
- **Example:** The conflict between `/api/characters` and `/api/user/characters` has been a recurring source of bugs, breaking character-dependent features.
- **Character Data:** The character data itself has been inconsistent, with issues related to stat scaling (Level 1 characters having endgame stats) and naming conventions.

**D. Complex Git Workflow:**
- The project has a history of difficult `git rebase` loops and complex merge conflicts between branches (`main`, `gabes-unmerged-changes`, etc.).
- This indicates that multiple developers (or AI agents) may be working in parallel without a strictly enforced branching and merging strategy, leading to integration problems.

**E. Mobile Responsiveness:**
- While significant work has been done to configure Tailwind CSS correctly, there are lingering issues with horizontal overflow and whitespace on mobile devices.
- This suggests that while the framework is in place, specific components still contain non-responsive elements (e.g., fixed widths, non-wrapping grids).

## 3. Path Forward & Recommendations

The project is in a state where foundational code exists, but stability is low due to the issues above. The next agent should prioritize as follows:

1.  **Resolve the Build Failure (Immediate Priority):**
    - The application cannot be tested or verified until it successfully builds and deploys.
    - **Action:** Investigate the Vercel/Railway build logs for the failure related to commit `72861f2`. This is the absolute first step.

2.  **Verify Authentication Flow (Post-Build):**
    - Once deployed, the immediate next step is to test the entire authentication flow: registration, login, and accessing protected routes.
    - **Action:** Use the test credentials (`test@example.com` / `test123`) to confirm that the `Token expired` and `Invalid credentials` errors are gone.

3.  **Systematic Bug Triage:**
    - With a stable build and working authentication, begin addressing the other known issues.
    - **Recommended Order:**
        1.  **Character Loading:** Ensure characters load correctly in all relevant tabs (Training, Battle, etc.).
        2.  **Battle Tab Crash:** Address the "Cannot access uninitialized variable" error if it persists.
        3.  **Mobile Responsiveness:** Hunt down the remaining sources of horizontal overflow.
        4.  **Data Integrity:** Review and correct character stat scaling and naming.

This README provides a snapshot of the project's current state based on the available information. The key to moving forward is to establish a stable build and deployment pipeline, which will allow for effective testing and iteration on the application's features.
