---

## 🔧 **Current System Status**

### **✅ Working Features:**
- **Complete battle system** with real-time WebSocket communication
- **Character database** with 5 seeded characters (Achilles, Merlin, Robin Hood, Cleopatra, Tesla)
- **Authentication system** (mock tokens for development)
- **Database operations** (create users, characters, battles)
- **Analytics tracking** for battle performance
- **Clean TypeScript compilation** for both frontend and backend

### **🎮 Battle System Flow:**
1. **Matchmaking** → Rating-based opponent matching with expandable wait windows
2. **Strategy Selection** → 15-second timer to choose aggressive/defensive/balanced
3. **Combat Rounds** → Turn-based with character abilities, status effects
4. **Chat Breaks** → 45-second character interaction periods
5. **Battle Resolution** → Rewards, XP, character progression, analytics

### **📡 API Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Server health check
- `GET /api/characters` - All available characters
- `GET /api/user/characters` - User's character collection
- `GET /api/battles/status` - Current queue size and active battles
- `GET /api/user/battles` - User's active battles
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration (mock)
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication (mock)

### **🔌 WebSocket Events:**
- `auth` / `authenticate` - User authentication
- `find_match` / `find_battle` - Start matchmaking
- `join_battle` - Connect to existing battle
- `select_strategy` - Choose battle strategy  
- `send_chat` - Chat during battle breaks
- Real-time battle events (combat, rounds, state updates)

---

## 📋 **Current Todo List**

### **High Priority:**
1. **Complete site audit** - Review all files for missed issues, placeholders, errors
2. **Frontend-backend integration testing** - Ensure WebSocket events align
3. **Character acquisition system** - Users need characters to battle
4. **Authentication improvement** - Replace mock tokens with real JWT system

### **Medium Priority:**
5. **Clean remaining lint errors** - ~100 unused imports in remaining components
6. **Redis integration** - For production multi-server battle system
7. **Error handling improvements** - More robust error messages and recovery
8. **Testing framework** - Unit tests for battle system

### **Future Enhancements:**
9. **Advanced coaching system** - Pre-battle and mid-battle coaching
10. **Equipment system integration** - Weapons and gear affecting battles
11. **Tournament system** - Multi-player brackets
12. **AI improvements** - Better character personality responses

---

## 🚨 **Known Issues & Areas Needing Attention**

### **Frontend:**
- **~100 remaining lint errors** - mostly unused imports in unprocessed components
- **Battle UI integration** - Frontend battle components need WebSocket connection
- **Character acquisition flow** - No UI for users to get their first character
- **Type mismatches** - Some frontend types may not align with backend

### **Backend:**
- **Mock authentication** - Needs real JWT implementation
- **User character seeding** - No characters assigned to demo users by default
- **Redis dependency** - Multi-server features require Redis setup
- **Error handling** - Some edge cases in battle system need improvement

### **Database:**
- **Migration system** - No automated schema updates
- **Data seeding** - Only characters are seeded, users start empty
- **Foreign key constraints** - Some relationships could be stricter

### **General:**
- **Environment configuration** - Missing .env variables documentation
- **Documentation** - API documentation needs updating
- **Performance testing** - Battle system not load tested
- **Security review** - WebSocket and API security needs audit

---

## 🔍 **Recommended Site Audit Areas**

### **1. File System Audit:**
- [ ] Check for unused files that can be removed
- [ ] Verify all imports are working correctly
- [ ] Look for remaining placeholders or TODO comments
- [ ] Ensure consistent file naming and organization

### **2. Code Quality Audit:**
- [ ] Scan for remaining TypeScript errors or warnings
- [ ] Check for console.log statements that should be removed
- [ ] Verify error handling is consistent throughout
- [ ] Review security practices (especially in auth and WebSocket code)

### **3. Integration Testing:**
- [ ] Test frontend-backend WebSocket communication
- [ ] Verify API endpoints work with frontend calls
- [ ] Check database operations from frontend to backend
- [ ] Test battle flow end-to-end with multiple users

### **4. Feature Completeness:**
- [ ] Ensure all battle system features are accessible from frontend

- Use `dbAdapter` for all database operations (don't use raw queries)
- Follow existing TypeScript interfaces in `battleService.ts`
- Use analytics tracking for user actions
- Maintain WebSocket event consistency between frontend/backend
- Keep battle state immutable where possible

### **Architecture Decisions:**
- SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production
- WebSocket for real-time battle communication
- REST API for standard CRUD operations
- Mock authentication for development ease
- Component-based frontend architecture

### **Testing Approach:**
- Manual testing through browser and API clients
- WebSocket testing via browser dev tools
- Database testing via direct SQLite queries
- End-to-end testing through frontend UI
