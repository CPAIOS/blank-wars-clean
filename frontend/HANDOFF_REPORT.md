## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

- Character relationships drive strategic decisions
- Coaching effectiveness depends on understanding individual personalities
- Long-term team building is more important than individual battles

### **User Experience Focus:**
- Players should feel like real coaches managing real personalities
- Unpredictability should feel authentic, not random
- Character disobedience should create dramatic moments, not frustration
- Success should come from psychological insight, not just tactical skill
