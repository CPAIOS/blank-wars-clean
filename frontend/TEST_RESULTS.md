### Summary
Successfully fixed all data persistence issues across 4 major game systems:

1. **Financial Coaching System** - Now properly saves financial decisions and updates to backend
2. **Therapy System** - Now properly saves all reward types and stat improvements
3. **Training System** - Now properly saves training progress with incremental stat updates
4. **Battle System** - Now properly loads real data instead of mock data

### Key Improvements Made:
- ✅ Removed all placeholder comments
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all API methods
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Fixed stat overwrite issues (now uses incremental updates)
- ✅ Added proper authentication integration
- ✅ Ensured all systems persist data correctly

### Technical Quality:
- ✅ No TypeScript errors in target files
- ✅ Proper error handling patterns
- ✅ Consistent API integration
- ✅ Build succeeds successfully

All critical data persistence issues have been resolved and the game now properly saves character progression, financial decisions, therapy outcomes, and training improvements to the backend.
