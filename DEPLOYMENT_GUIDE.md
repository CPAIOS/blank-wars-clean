4. **Add Environment Variables** in Railway:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-here
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...  (Railway provides this)
   FRONTEND_URL=https://your-game.vercel.app
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
   ```
5. **Deploy** → Railway will auto-detect Dockerfile

### 💡 Alternative: Deploy to Render.com
